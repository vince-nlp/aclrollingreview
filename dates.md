ARR deadlines happen __every 2 months__, on the 15th of even-numbered months: that is, **the 15th of February, April, June, August, October, and December**.[^1]

[^1]: In the past, deadlines were on the 15th of each month, and for a brief period, the [deadlines were every 6 weeks](/six-week-cycles/). As of October 2022, we've moved to [every 2 months](/key-changes-in-the-october-cycle/).

## Submission to Participating Venues

Any paper that is not desk rejected will receive reviews. Once authors have reviews they may:
- revise and resubmit for another round of reviews (typically papers will go back to the same action editor and reviewers)
- submit their paper *and reviews* to a publication venue

Current publication venues participating in ARR are listed below. If you represent a publication venue and would like to be added to this list, please see [this page](/organizers).
