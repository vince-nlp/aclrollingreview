title: "Area Keywords at ARR"

At present, ARR offers 26 areas, including 2 new areas in April 2024: we are adding the Language Modeling area, and Human-Centered NLP area, in response to many requests.

Choosing the right area may be tricky for the authors, and to aid them, in this page we provide the keywords associated with ARR areas. This list is based on [ACL'23 list](https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/reviewer-assignment/), and we expect it to change over time. It is not meant to be exhaustive, but it should still give some idea of what is the focus of different areas. In the future, they can be used to analyze the submission volume for different subtopics (so that we could tell which areas are growing and may need their own areas), and for paper-reviewer matching.

How does one choose the right area, given that there are so many overlaps? Here are a few examples: 

- Should a question answering resource paper go to the resource area or the question answering area? Generally, if there is a task-specific area, it takes both modeling and resource papers, but if your paper is very centered on data collection methodology, you might still want to consider the resource area. 
- What about a paper on multilingual generation? It could go for the generation area if the focus is on generation strategies, or to the multilingualism area - if the focus is on those languages.
- What about work in low-resource settings - is it efficiency or multilingualism? If the focus is on the training, and the low-resource setting is simulated from a well-resourced language, then we'd suggest the efficiency area. If you are contributing resources, analysis, or new solutions for languages that haven't had that kind of thing before, consider the multilingualism area.
